In the upper right corner of the Series card is the chapters un-read count. See “Houdoku Current Series Page Layout 2026-01-04.jpg”

I want to add to that. I wish to show the total number of chapters after the un-read chapters.
I want it to look like (un-read chapters) : (total chapters), “100 : 150”. I want all the numbers to still be backed by the orange background. Do not add parenthesis they are only for reference.

**Modifying UI elements**

I need to modify LibraryGrid.tsx to adjust the UI so that the total chapters display after the unread count, with a colon and space in between. I want to make sure both numbers have an orange background. First, I should open the file and use a concise preamble message before making the tool call. I’ll start by calling functions.read_file after providing that preamble. Let's get to it!I'll open the `LibraryGrid.tsx` component to find the series card unread count and update it to show "unread : total" with both numbers inside the orange badge.
