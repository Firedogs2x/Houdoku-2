# Customizing scrollbar thumb color in settings (2025-11-30 16:29Z)

_**User (2025-11-30 16:30Z)**_

On the All Series page the thumb of the scroll bar on the right hand side is very dark. Can you show me where the color setting is for the thumb?

The scrollbar thumb is controlled by workbench color tokens (scrollbarSlider.*). Update them in your user settings.

1. Open Settings (JSON) — use Preferences: Open User Settings.
2. Add/modify workbench.colorCustomizations with these tokens: scrollbarSlider.background, scrollbarSlider.hoverBackground, scrollbarSlider.activeBackground.
3. Save; changes apply immediately.

Example setting to change the thumb color:
