# An issue has been found. (2026-01-10 02:10Z)

An issue has been found.
I have the Filters set to Unread and Ongoing.
So, when I finish reading all of the chapters in a Series when I return to the home page the Series should be not visible. But that is not happening. In fact, on the home page the Series is still showing that from the time I viewed the Series to the time I returned to the home page the chapters count has not been updated.
Example: On the home page When I view the Series card for Manga Fun (example title) it shows that there are two chapters left to read before the unread chapter count equals zero. So, I click on the Series card and I am taken to the Series page. After reading the last two chapters I am returned to the Series page. On the Series page I see that all of the chapters are marked as read. After exiting the Series page and returning to the home page the Series card still shows that there are two chapters that have not been read.
This means for some reason the home page is not being updated after exiting the Series page.
Until the most recent changes there was never this issue.
Please review the code to determine why this is happening.
Give a detail explanation why this is happening ang how it can be fixed.

**Using the todo list tool**

I need to use the manage_todo_list tool as a reminder, and I should start with a preamble message before the tool call. I’ll start by searching for relevant files, focusing on LibraryGrid.tsx for the home page update. I'm looking for state updates, subscriptions, and read state trackers. I'll use grep_search and mention that I'll search the repository for unread and ongoing filters along with reading status before making the call.I'll search the codebase for components and services that manage unread/ongoing filters and series read-state updates.**Inspecting library service code**

I need to look into the library service code, specifically in LibraryGrid.tsx, to see how it fetches the series list and if it subscribes to library changes. I'll open that file first. Additionally, I should check the library state/service in src/renderer/services/library.ts. I’ll use the read_file tool to inspect these details. Remember, I'll include a preamble before making those tool calls to keep things organized. Let’s fetch LibraryGrid first!Now I'll open `LibraryGrid.tsx` and the library service to inspect how the home page list is populated and updated.
