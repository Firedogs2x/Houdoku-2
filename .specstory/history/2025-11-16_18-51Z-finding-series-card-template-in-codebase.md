# Finding series card template in codebase (2025-11-16 18:51Z)

_**User (2025-11-16 18:52Z)**_

can you find the template for the series card that is created when a new series is added

---

_**Agent (model copilot/auto)**_

I'll add a short plan, then search the repo for components/templates named like "SeriesCard" or "series card".Now listing files under the renderer library components to find the series card implementation.Opening `LibraryGrid.tsx` and `LibraryList.tsx` to inspect how series items are rendered.Opening `LibraryList.tsx` to see list-style series rendering.**Finding series card template**

I'm looking into the template for the series card found in LibraryGrid.tsx for grid view and LibraryList.tsx for list view. The user likely wants the template used during the addition of a new series to the library, possibly through downloads or a placeholder. There's probably an "Add Series" modal for this as well. I need to update my to-do list, marking the appropriate steps as completed or in progress. Steps 1-3 can be marked as completed.**Updating to-do list and presenting findings**

I’m updating the to-do list to mark the search as completed and the files as inspected. Then, I’ll call manage_todo_list to write that all items are completed and provide their statuses. For my final answer, I’ll use concise explanations and headers only if they help. 

The card template is in `apps/desktop/src/renderer/components/library/LibraryGrid.tsx` for grid view and `LibraryList.tsx` for list view, rendering in a JSX map. I’ll include next steps, like if the user wants me to open the `ExtensionImage` or the context menu.**Offering additional code search**

I’ll also offer to search for where a new series is created in the code, as the user might want to see the creation code. Their request about the "template for the series card" likely relates to the UI card. I’ll ask a clarifying question and offer to show relevant code, like the `ExtensionImage` and `LibraryGridContextMenu`, along with important JSX snippets from `LibraryGrid`. 

For the final answer, I’ll ensure brevity and include next steps, like asking if they want to "Open `ExtensionImage`" or "Trace where new series is added."**Updating to-do list completion**

I need to ask the user which option they prefer. Meanwhile, I should update the to-do list since I’ve already set some items as completed. I’ll call manage_todo_list now and write that all three steps are completed, including providing their statuses. This will keep everything organized and ensure the user knows where we stand on tasks. It's good to keep communication clear and provide options!Now I'll mark the todo steps completed (search + inspect + report).Findings
- **Files:** `LibraryGrid.tsx` and `LibraryList.tsx`
- **Role:** `LibraryGrid.tsx` renders the series “card” in grid views (cover image, unread badge, title). `LibraryList.tsx` renders the list-row alternative.
- **Key pieces:** `ExtensionImage` is used for the cover image, and `LibraryGridContextMenu` provides the card context menu. The grid card is produced inside a `.map` over `props.getFilteredList()`.

Relevant JSX (from `LibraryGrid.tsx`)
- The cover + click handler:
  - `ExtensionImage url={coverSource} series={series} alt={series.title} ... />`
  - Click toggles multi-select or navigates (`viewFunc(series)`)
- The unread badge:
  - `{series.numberUnread > 0 && <div className="...">{series.numberUnread}</div>}`
- The title for compact/comfortable views is rendered right below the cover.

Next steps (pick one)
- I can open `ExtensionImage` to show how the cover is composed.
- I can open `LibraryGridContextMenu` to show context actions.
- I can search where the code adds/creates a new Series (backend/service) if you meant the data-side template rather than the UI card.

Which would you like me to do next?

@workspace /explain Cannot find module '@houdoku/ui/components/ContextMenu' or its corresponding type declarations.

Looking at your code, you have a **module resolution error** for `@houdoku/ui/components/ContextMenu`. This means the package or path alias isn't properly configured or installed.

Here are the most likely causes and solutions:

## 1. **Package not installed**
Run:
```bash
npm install @houdoku/ui
```

## 2. **Path alias misconfiguration**
If `@houdoku/ui` is a local package or path alias, verify your `tsconfig.json` has the correct mapping:

````json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@houdoku/ui/*": ["path/to/houdoku/ui/*"]
    }
  }
}
````

## 3. **Check package exports**
Verify the package actually exports from that path. The `@houdoku/ui` package may export differently:
- Try `@houdoku/ui` directly
- Check the package's `package.json` for `exports` field
- Look for a `dist` folder: `@houdoku/ui/dist/components/ContextMenu`

## 4. **IDE cache issue**
Try restarting VS Code's TypeScript server:
- Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
- Run "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

**Quick question**: Is `@houdoku/ui` an internal monorepo package or an external npm package? That'll help narrow down the exact fix.
