# Version number verification and update options (2025-11-16 17:48Z)

_**User (2025-11-16 17:51Z)**_

I need to verify that the version number has increased from 2.16.0 to 2.17.0

**Searching for package versions**

I'm thinking about how to use regex for exact strings, like searching for '2.16.0|2.17.0' with the `grep_search` tool requiring the isRegexp boolean. I need to know the paths for `package.json` files in the workspace, like at the root, apps/desktop, and packages/ui. Once `grep_search` returns results, I’ll give a brief update and outline the next steps. I'll execute `manage_todo_list` first and include a helpful preamble before making tool calls.**Creating a Todo Plan**

I'm planning to start by adding a short todo list and then scanning the repository for occurrences of '2.16.0' and '2.17.0'. After that, I'll call the `manage_todo_list` function to keep everything organized. I just want to clarify the steps I’m taking before I execute them, to make sure I’m on the right track. Alright, let’s proceed with this plan!I'll add a short todo plan and then scan the repo for occurrences of "2.16.0" and "2.17.0".Now I'll search the workspace for either version string.**Updating progress on file reads**

I plan to perform three read_file calls, and I need to remember to provide a progress update after the third call. It's essential to start with a preamble sentence to set the context. Keeping things clear and organized will definitely help with tracking everything. So, I'll get going on those file reads and make sure to keep the user informed throughout the process as I move along!Next I'll open the root, ``, and `` `package.json` files to check their `version` fields.**Verifying version updates**

I found that the `apps/desktop/package.json` is at version "2.16.0," while the repository folder name suggests it should be "2.17.0." So, it looks like the version hasn't been updated after all. The documentation and other files reference 2.16.0 too. I'll ask the user if they want me to update it to 2.17.0 and possibly update the documentation. Plus, I need to mark specific tasks in the todo list as completed. Let's take care of that!I'll update the todo list statuses to show that the checks have been completed. Once I do that, I'll call the manage_todo_list function. After that, I want to send a final message to the user that summarizes my findings and suggests the next steps. It’s essential to keep everything clear and organized. Let’s get the manage_todo_list prepared so we can move forward!I'll mark the plan steps as completed now and summarize findings.Summary of findings:

- `package.json`: version is "2.16.0" — not updated to 2.17.0.
- `package.json`: version is "0.0.0" (unrelated to the desktop app version).
- Root `package.json` is a monorepo manifest and has no `version` field.
- Built/generated docs and assets in `` and `` contain references to "2.16.0" (these are generated files).

Conclusion: the app's package version was not updated in `package.json` — it still shows 2.16.0. Generated docs also still reference 2.16.0.

Options (pick one):
- I can update `package.json` to `"version": "2.17.0"` and leave generated docs alone (they'll update when docs are rebuilt).
- I can update `package.json` and search/patch generated docs/assets that reference 2.16.0.
- Or I can stop here if you only needed verification.

Which would you like me to do?
