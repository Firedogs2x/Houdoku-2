# I want to add a new chapter indicator.  (2026-01-09 14:28Z)

_**User (2026-01-09 14:28Z)**_

I want to add a new chapter indicator. 
Change untread to unread.
When either the unread Boolean is equal to True or the date of one or more chapters in a series is newer than the date last read date for the series, I want an image to appear on the Series card. See “Houdoku Current Series Page Layout W - New Chapter 2026-01-09.jpg”. Otherwise hide the image
The image consists of a black circle 25 pixels diameter 100% fill, with a green (R=0, G=90, B=0) circle 15 pixels diameter directly centered on the black circle.
Try and located the image slightly spaced from the chapter counts, and roughly centered (right to left) of the chapter counts.
Please review and verify that this is something that can be accomplished before changing the code.

**Planning multi-step tasks**

I need to start by creating a plan using the manage_todo_list tool, following the necessary preambles before making any tool calls. First, I'll outline the steps: 1) Inspect the Series card component in LibraryGrid.tsx, 2) Identify the unread boolean and chapter dates, and perhaps series.lastReadDate, 3) Add a new UI element next to chapter counts styled as specified, 4) Implement logic to check for new chapters based on unread status, 5) Style and handle image rendering, and 6) Test the implementation. Lastly, I'll search for the relevant files.**Preparing to read files and manage tasks**

I need to use the read_file function, but first, I should include a brief preamble to explain what I'm doing. After that, I can call read_file to open LibraryGrid.tsx fully. I'll prepare to use the manage_todo_list tool as well, making sure to use it in a multi-step process for listing and writing tasks. It's all about coordinating these calls to ensure everything runs smoothly. I’ve got this plan in mind!I'll create a short plan (todo list) for the change before inspecting the component.
